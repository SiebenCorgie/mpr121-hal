//! # MPR121-Hal
//!
//! This crate follows the [Adafruit implementation](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_MPR121) closely but exposes it in terms of the embedded-hal project.
//!
//! The main responsibility of this crate is returning the current on/off state of all the (up to) 12 pins.
//!
//! The chip's data sheet can be found [here](https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/data-sheet/MPR121.pdf). The implementation however mostly mirrors the Adafruit implementation,
//! since this is probably the most widely used one.
//!
