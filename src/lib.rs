//! # MPR121-Hal
//!
//! This crate follows the [Adafruit implementation](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_MPR121) closely but exposes it in terms of the embedded-hal project.
//!
//! The main responsibility of this crate is returning the current on/off state of all the (up to) 12 pins.
//!
//! The chip's data sheet can be found [here](https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/data-sheet/MPR121.pdf). The implementation however mostly mirrors the Adafruit implementation,
//! since this is probably the most widely used one.
//!
//! When working with this crate you can either use it in Synchronous/Blocking mode with the [embedded-hal](https://crates.io/crates/embedded-hal) or in Asynchronous mode with the [embedded-hal-async](https://crates.io/crates/embedded-hal-async).
//!This can be done by using the features `sync` and `async`. This crate does not pull in the `std` library and thus is fully `no-std`.
//! For MCU scale devices [Embassy](https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy) is a valid framework to use the async feature or [Tokio](https://tokio.rs/) when using Linux/MacOS based devices.
