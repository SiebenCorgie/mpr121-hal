[Mpr121](https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/data-sheet/MPR121.pdf) proximity capacitive touch sensor controller driver. Used for instance on the [Adafruit Mpr121 module](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1982).

## Overview

The crate uses the common [embeded-hal](https://crates.io/crates/embedded-hal) crate to provided a generic implementation for multiple HALs.

The implementation provides a similar API to the C++ Adafruit library. It should work with similar boards using the Mpr121 as well.

## Example

<!-- TODO
The esp32-hal example creates the IÂ²C master and tries to read sensor data on pin 1 and 2. Build and run via:
```shell
cargo espflash --release /dev/ttyUSB0 && espmonitor /dev/ttyUSB0
```
